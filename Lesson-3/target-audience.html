            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Tom just woke up and is getting ready for class. He lives close enough to campus that he can walk to class, but before he leaves,
                    he notices the clouds outside. He doesn't want to get any of his textbooks or laptop wet. Should he pack an umbrella?</li>
                <li>Mary is trying to get her kids ready for school. It was a little chilly outside yesterday. 
                She wants to make sure her kids have enough layers to keep themselves warm when they go outside for recess.</li>
                <li>Tom is planning to go fishing at the lake this weekend. 
                The lake is more than an hour away from his house and is planning to spend the entire day at the lake if he goes. 
                Wanting to make the most of his fishing trip, he wonders if this weekend will be a good day to go fishing.</li>
                <li>Mary is planning a picnic with her family. She doesn't know what the weather will look like on the day she wants to go.
                She's wondering if she needs to pack sunscreen and an umbrella.</li>
                <li>Tom is about to go to bed, but he just remembered his dad telling him that it's going to be hail this week. He doesn't remember if it was tonight 
                or later that week, but he just got comfy in bed and doesn't want to leave. Should he move his car in the garage or stay in bed?</li>
