            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The target audience is mainly targeted towards families but will also target ward/groups of people who are traveling to visit the temple and need a place to stay if they don’t live in the area and don’t know anyone who lives in the area. The hotel is temple themed and customers can rest assure that they’ll be treat with respect during their stay and won’t need to worry about the well-being of their children if they decide to bring them along.

            <ol>
                <li>Tom has been feelign down lately and wants to go to the temple. The temples have just been recently opened but he doesn't know what COVID response stage each temple is in</li>
                <li>Mary's youngest son just turned 12 and was just ordinated into the priesthood. She wants to bring him to the temple but doesn't live near one. Where should she go?

                <li>Tom is looking for a place to stay while he's in Hawaii. He wants to visit the temple there and is looking for accomodations that are cheap and near the temple. </li>
                <li>Ryan is the bishop of his ward. He wants to plan a ward trip to the temple for the youth but there isn't one nearby. The closest temple will take multiple hours to drive to, so he will need to find a place for the youth to stay over night. Is there an appropriate place to stay near the temple he's planning on taking the youth to?</li>
                <li>Tom has just found out about a long-lost side of the family that he never knew about.
